 # Cookies

 ##  How To Use Cookies?

 setcookie( Name[ Required ], value , expire , path , domin , secure , HTTP_Only )

 ```php
 setcookie("style" , "dark" , time()+ 60 * 60 * 24 * 30); // keep change in Cookie for 1 month

 echo "<pre>";
 print_r($_Cookies);
 echo "</pre>";

 echo $_Cookies["style"];

 ```
 ## Session

 - is stored on the server
 - store only a user key in cookie to know it's you
 - key are generated by PHP engine so it's almost impossible to guess
 - you need to add it before any output

 ```php
 session_start();
 $_SESSION['name'] = "basmala";
 $_SESSION['id'] = 2035;

 echo "<pre>";
 print_r($_SESSION);
 echo "</pre>";
 ```
 
 ```php
 session_start();
 echo "welcome " . $_SESSION['name'] . "and your id is " . $_SESSION['id'];
 // output ===> "welcome basmala and your id is 2035
 ```
